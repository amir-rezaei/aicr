# Fetch a GitHub API resource with bounded retry, publishing the response to
# OUTFILE only on success. Recovers HTTP 5xx/429 and connection failures alike,
# and round-trips a binary payload (e.g. an artifact zip) intact: each attempt
# writes to OUTFILE.part and is renamed into place only when gh exits 0, so a
# failed attempt's HTTP-error body never leaks downstream. On any non-success
# exit an EXIT trap removes both OUTFILE and OUTFILE.part, so a failed run never
# leaves a partial or stale OUTFILE for a later step to consume (the caller's
# `set -e` then aborts the step, which the workflow treats as an operational
# failure, never a security signal).
#
# Usage: gh-api-retry.sh OUTFILE gh-api-args...
# Requires: gh, authenticated via GH_TOKEN in the environment.
set -euo pipefail

# Per-attempt wall-clock bound so a stalled `gh api` call fails fast and lets the
# loop retry (and ultimately emit the fallback error), rather than hanging until
# the job-level timeout. Comfortably above a normal paginated read yet well below
# the workflow's job budget.
